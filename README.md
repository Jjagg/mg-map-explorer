This is a simple sample for [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) that draws part of a Texture2D or RenderTarget2D to the screen and lets the player scroll around.

Controls: 
- Arrow keys to move around
- Z/X to zoom in/out
- S to switch between the included texture and the render target
- H to toggle the minimap
